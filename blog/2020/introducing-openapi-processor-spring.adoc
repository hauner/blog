link:{oap-docs}[*openapi-processor-spring*] (or short: _oap-spring_) is an link:{openapi}[OpenAPI]
interface & model Java code generator for link:{springboot}[Spring Boot]. It is generating code
for annotation based (MVC) controllers.
footnote:[oap-spring has experimental support for `Mono<>` and `Flux<>` like wrappers that makes it
possible to use WebFlux with annotations.]

Its goal is to provide a smooth & straight forward mapping from an OpenAPI yaml description to
Spring Boot Java code:

* allowing common Spring Boot code patterns, like passing additional parameters (for example
`HttpServletRequest` or `HandlerMethodArgumentResolver`) to controller endpoints without adding it
to the OpenAPI description

* providing an easy mapping to existing Java types with (simple) generic support

* getting out of the way if the processor does not create the expected code for single endpoints.


You will need a gradle based spring boot project and the link:{oap-gradle}[oap-gradle plugin]
to use oap-spring.
